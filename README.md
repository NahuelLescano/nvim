# NVIM configs
This is my personal nvim configs.

## Package manager
I'm using folke Lazy package manager to install all my plugins
* [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

## Plugins
These are all my plugins that I installed
* [Oil](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim) - A vim-vinegar like file explorer that lets you edit your filesystem like a normal Neovim buffer.
* [blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp) - Is a completion plugin with support for LSPs and external sources that updates on every keystroke. 
* [lsp](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) - Nvim supports the Language Server Protocol (LSP), which means it acts as a client to LSP servers and includes a Lua framework vim.lsp for building enhanced LSP tools, but the servers are provided by third parties. You could install lsp's manually or use [meson](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim). I'm using the last.
* [todo](https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim) - A sweet highlight todo comments like TODO, HACK, BUG, etc...
* [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) - A blazing fast and easy to configure Neovim statusline written in Lua.
* [Harpoon 2](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) - Getting you where you want with the fewest keystrokes.
* [Trouble](https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim) - A pretty list for showing diagnostics, references, telescope results, quickfix and location lists to help you solve all the trouble your code is causing.
* [undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree) - A better way to see all your history.
* [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) - Move through your project fast. You should use it with fzf.
* [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim) - My favorites colorschemes are catppuccin.
* [Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) - It gives syntax highlighting on files.

## Other configs
Beside I have other configurations like:
* ftplugin - Adds some extra configuration for a type specific file.
* muligrep - A personal plugin to search something across files in a project. 
* menu - Costum options on menus. To use it press right click.

Those configs was inspired from [TJ's Advent of code videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsKSuQSutaI "Great work TJ").
